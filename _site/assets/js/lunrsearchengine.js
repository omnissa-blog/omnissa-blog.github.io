    "title": "Enhancing OAuth 2.0 Security with PKCE: A Deep Dive into External Partner Integration",
    "body": "2025/03/23 - Introduction: In the modern digital landscape, security is paramount, especially when dealing with third-party integrations that require authentication and authorization. OAuth 2. 0 is widely adopted as a secure authorization framework, but traditional flows, such as the implicit flow, have proven vulnerable to security risks like token interception. To mitigate these risks, the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension was introduced, enhancing OAuth security by ensuring that authorization requests and token exchanges originate from the same client. This article explores how Omnissa Intelligence integrates with multiple External Partner services using OAuth 2. 0 with PKCE, offering a secure authentication mechanism that prevents authorization code interception attacks. What is Omnissa Intelligence?: Omnissa Intelligence is a data-driven platform that provides actionable insights across end-user computing (EUC) environments. It enables organizations to enhance security, performance, and compliance through intelligent automation, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with various enterprise solutions. By leveraging AI-driven insights, Omnissa Intelligence helps IT and security teams make informed decisions to optimize user experience and reduce operational risks. For more details, visit Omnissa Intelligence. What is PKCE?: PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is an enhancement to the OAuth 2. 0 authorization framework, designed specifically for public clients such as mobile apps, browser-based applications, and other applications where client secrets cannot be securely stored. PKCE helps protect against authorization code interception attacks by introducing dynamically generated code challenge and code verifier parameters. At a high level, this is an overview of how the flow appears.  Key PKCE Parameters:  Code Verifier: A cryptographically random string used to correlate the authorization request with the token request.  Code Challenge: A transformation of the code verifier (e. g. , SHA-256 hashed and Base64 URL encoded) sent in the authorization request.  Code Challenge Method: Specifies the method used to derive the code challenge, typically S256. Why PKCE is Critical for External Partner Integrations: External Partner services mandate PKCE-based OAuth 2. 0 integration for third-party applications such as Omnissa Intelligence to mitigate security threats. Traditional OAuth flows rely on client secrets, but public applications cannot store them securely. This introduces risks such as authorization code theft, allowing attackers to exchange stolen codes for access tokens, gaining unauthorized access to user data. By enforcing OAuth PKCE, External Partner services ensure that only the original requesting client can exchange an authorization code for an access token. This security measure protects against session hijacking, token theft, and man-in-the-middle attacks. PKCE Flow Overview: The OAuth 2. 0 PKCE flow for Omnissa Intelligence integrating with an External Partner follows these steps: During the initial step (https://external-partner. com/oauth/authorize) of the OAuth procedure, the Omnissa Intelligence Authorization Server provides the code_challenge parameter to the External Partner Authorization Server. After the user manually authorizes the application, the External Partner Authorization Server responds with an Authorization Code, which must then be returned to the External Partner Authorization Server along with the code_verifier parameter by the Omnissa Intelligence Authorization Server, in exchange for an Access Token. If the code_verifier parameter does not match the code_challenge provided by Omnissa Intelligence Authorization Server in the initial authorization request, this may indicate an attempted code injection attack. In this case, the External Partner Authorization Server should abort the OAuth process and return an error. If the External Partner Authorization Server verifies that the code_challenge and code_verifier match, the token exchange request is processed successfully, and the External Partner Authorization Server issues an Access Token via the token endpoint (https://external-partner. com/oauth/token). Sample Requests:Omnissa Intelligence redirects the user to the External Partner Authorization Server for authentication, including the Code Challenge in the request. 12345678910Authorization Requesthttps://partner-auth. com/oauth/authorize  ?response_type=code  &amp;client_id=OMNISSA_INTEL_CLIENT_ID  &amp;redirect_uri=OMNISSA_INTEL_REDIRECT_URI  &amp;code_challenge=GENERATED_CODE_CHALLENGE  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256  &amp;state=RANDOM_STATE  &amp;scope=REQUESTED_SCOPESThe External Partner redirects the user back to the Omnissa Intelligence Authorization Server redirection endpoint with Authorization Code &amp; State Parameter (to prevent CSRF attacks) 12345Redirect URLhttps://omnissa-intelligence. com/oauth/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&amp;state=RANDOM_STATEThe Omnissa Intelligence Authorization Server sends a POST request to the External Partner Authorization Server, including Authorization Code, Code Verifier (original random string), Client ID &amp; Redirect URI 123456789Token Exchange(POST Request)POST https://partner-auth. com/oauth/tokenContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedgrant_type=authorization_code&amp;client_id=OMNISSA_INTEL_CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=OMNISSA_INTEL_REDIRECT_URI&amp;code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&amp;code_verifier=ORIGINAL_CODE_VERIFIERThe External Partner Authorization Server validates: Authorization Code (to ensure it’s valid), Code Verifier (must match the previously hashed Code Challenge). If verification succeeds, the External Partner Authorization Server issues an Access Token &amp; Refresh Token. 12345678Token Response{ access_token :  ACCESS_TOKEN , token_type :  Bearer , refresh_token :  REFRESH_TOKEN , expires_in : 3600}Conclusion: By implementing OAuth 2. 0 with PKCE, Omnissa Intelligence ensures a secure, scalable, and compliant authentication flow when integrating with External Partner services. PKCE eliminates the need for client secrets, although in some cases, it is required with the Authorization Code. This helps reduce risks such as authorization code interception and token theft. This standardized OAuth 2. 0 PKCE flow provides a secure foundation for all future integrations, ensuring consistent authentication security across applications. Adopting PKCE enhances protection against evolving threats, making third-party integrations robust, reliable, and future-proof. For more details, visit Omnissa Intelligence. "

It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. "

Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

    "body": "2018/01/11 - Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise. As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: “When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?” The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”). Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ” (The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film’s ending. ) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!). A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we do spoilers?: 1&lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"
