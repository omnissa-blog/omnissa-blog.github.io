## What is Omnissa Intelligence?
Omnissa Intelligence is a cloud-native platform designed to unify and analyze telemetry across digital workspaces, providing actionable insights that drive efficiency, security, and user satisfaction. By aggregating data from various sources — including devices, applications, and user interactions — it enables organizations to monitor digital workspace metrics, proactively identify issues, and automate remediation processes.

* Aggregates and correlates data from multiple sources for actionable insights
* Leverage dashboards/reports/automations for optimized IT operations
* Enhance employee productivity and engagement by monitoring digital workspace metrics that impact user experience
* Leverage machine learning models to gain deep insights across your digital workspace

Built on a scalable architecture hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Omnissa Intelligence leverages machine learning models to assess user risk scores based on activity and device context. This facilitates a zero-trust security approach, ensuring continuous verification and compliance across the enterprise.

The platform’s impact is evident across various industries. For instance, West Midlands Police utilized Omnissa Intelligence to enhance mobility and productivity for their officers, while Rentokil Initial successfully migrated 12,000 iOS devices to Workspace ONE in just three months, streamlining their operations

With a customer base spanning over 26,000 organizations worldwide, Omnissa Intelligence continues to be a trusted solution for enterprises seeking to optimize their digital work environments.
