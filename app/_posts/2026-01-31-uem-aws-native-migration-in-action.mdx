## Challenge

Following the decision to transition the UEM SaaS offering to a fully native AWS architecture, we undertook one of the largest platform modernization and migration efforts. The challenge was not just migrating—it was **automating, rebuilding, and operating the platform at unprecedented scale**.

Migrating the UEM SaaS platform to AWS native meant tackling **1,200+ production environments** and the supporting services across **11 datacenters**, all while ensuring minimal disruption to customers. In parallel, 4 non-production datacenters have to migrated to validate automation and test at scale, ensuring every step was reliable before touching live workloads.

At this scale, even a 1% failure rate could impact dozens of customer environments, making **reliability, repeatability, and automation non-negotiable**. Success required re-architecting the platform with **infrastructure-as-code**, **end-to-end automation**, and **AWS-native services**—all must be executed in a controlled, measurable, low-risk way to safeguard every customer environment.

## Migration Plan

To migrate the UEM SaaS platform at scale, we structured our approach around five key pillars:

- Modernization,
- Infrastructure Deployment,
- Automation Readiness,
- Security,
- Observability.

Each pillar focused on building a fully automated, cloud-native, and secure platform. The table below presents a comprehensive overview of our approach, emphasizing the critical actions executed throughout the migration process.

| **Pillar**    | **What We Did**           | **Goal** | 
| ------------  | ------------------------- | ------------- | 
| Modernization | • FSx replaced legacy Windows shares <br /> • AWS Managed AD adoption <br /> • RDS  for SQL server <br /> • ElastiCache for Memcached <br /> • AWCM containerized on ECS Fargate | 100% cloud-native, scalable services|
| Infrastructure Deployment | • Custom AMIs built for standardized deployments <br /> • Terraform automation for all deployments <br /> • IaC for repeatable provisioning | No manual touchpoints — all deployments via code|
| Automation Readiness | • Multi-platform support (VMC + AWS) <br /> • Day-2 operations seamless <br /> | Zero gaps during cross-platform migration |
| Security | • Custom security groups for service communication <br /> • Rapid7 → Wiz migration <br /> | Security embedded from day one |
| Observability | • Full metrics & monitoring <br /> • Continuous dashboard updates <br /> | Full visibility across workloads |


## Engineering Hurdles

There were countless challenges we had to tackle during this migration, but some of the most complex and high-scale tasks included:
-   One of the biggest challenges was rewriting automation for UEM databases on RDS SQL Server and UEM applications on EC2, while simultaneously designing robust rollback strategies to move fast without sacrificing safety.  
-   Our automation platform had to operate in two platform at once—keeping existing customer environments running on VMC while powering AWS-native environments for migrations, all without missing a beat on Day-2 operations like scaling, patching, upgrading, and UEM lifecycle management.
-   Moving multiple terabytes of data from VMC Windows shares to Amazon FSx ran continuously for days. Every byte had to be verified before we could safely reconfigure thousands of environments—because at this scale, mistakes weren’t  an option.

Each of these hurdles pushed our engineering limits—and overcoming them is what made the migration  run at scale.

## Migration in Action

Before we could kick off the migration, we had to lay the foundation—and it was massive. We built a robust infrastructure that could handle scale, performance, and reliability at every step. Here’s a glimpse of what we brought to life:

-   100+ RDS SQL Servers
-   120+ Elasticache  Clusters
-   250+ ETL Clusters
-   4,000+ EC2 Instances

Next, the migration unfolded in two high-impact phases
- **Phase 1** – UAT: We moved ~400 UAT environments to native in just 6–7 weeks—smooth, fast, and precise.
- **Phase 2** – Production:  The real challenge. 850+ PROD environments had to be migrated, all while coordinating timelines with customers and juggling requests. Despite the complexity, we pulled it off in a record of  9 weeks, hitting every target and keeping very minimal discrepancy.

While migrating customer environments remained our top priority, we deployed 4 non-production datacenters —all in parallel and without a hitch.
From infrastructure to execution, this migration was big, bold, and lightning-fast—a true showcase of planning, teamwork, and automation.

## Outcome in Focus

After overcoming enormous engineering hurdles, the results spoke for themselves.

-   **Effortless, lightning-fast migrations:** Single-click automation allowed us to move hundreds of environments at scale without breaking a sweat.
-   **Provisioning at warp speed:** Leveraging Infrastructure as Code turned complex service setup into a repeatable, near-instant process, every time.
-   **More power, zero extra cost:** By enhancing infrastructure and adopting managed services, we deliver higher performance and reliability while keeping costs on par with our VMC deployment.

These outcomes didn’t just demonstrate technical excellence—they showed what’s possible when automation, planning, and engineering at scale to come together.
